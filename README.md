# Chrome history code

Google Sheets wasn't capable of handling the 15,000+ lines of my Chrome history file so I'm editing and examining it programmatically.

I got the history by [this method](https://gist.github.com/TravelingTechGuy/7ac464f6cccde912a6ec7a1e2f8aa96a) via StackOverflow.

I'm `.gitignore`-ing my actual history but the code shouldn't be compromising.
